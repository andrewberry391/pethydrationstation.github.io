      <div class="w3-container w3-white">
        <p>In this first week of working on our hydration station, we were planning to (1) research and order parts online, (2) learn how to use different protocols in lab 3, and (3) continue to refine our website. We are successfully competing these tasks. The progress in each area is listed below.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Research and order parts online for the project. We have researched and bought the following items:
            <ul type="circle">
              <li>
                A servo motor to open and close the water dispenser valve. We chose the SG90 Digital Servo motor. We chose it because of its availability in the shop (no long associated delivery time) and its low cost.  One potential draw back of this motor could be that it is not strong enough to open and close the water dispenser valve. Once we have the water dispenser, we will be able to test if it is powerful enough. 
              </li>
              <li>
                Sensor to sense water level falling below threshold using I2C. We chose the Adafruit STEMMA Soil Sensor - I2C Capacitive Moisture Sensor (<a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/4026">https://www.adafruit.com/product/4026</a>). We chose this sensor, as it operates with I2C, costs only 7.50 USD and has been proven to work well in a project our peers conduced. 
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Learn how to use different protocols
            <ul type="circle">
              <li>
                This week, we have been completing lab 3. In this lab we have learned how to use UART and how to interface with a Bluetooth module using it. Furthermore, we learned to use SPI to receive gyroscope measurements. We will be using I2C in order to receive temperature measurements. This knowledge will be important for our project and we will likely be able to use some of the functions we wrote this week to communicate with the STEMMA Soil Sensor and all other peripherals. 
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Continue to refine our website:
            <ul type="circle">
              <li>We now both have access to editing this website (previously we would log in via one of our accounts). We have added a block diagram to better represent the modules of our project (see “Project Proposal” below).
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>To do next week:</p>
        <ul tpye="disc">
          <li>
            Research and buy a water dispenser and a water dispenser valve. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Test the servo motor on this dispenser to allow for some time to order a stronger motor if necessary. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Finish lab 3, and therefore become familiar with I2C in order to start writing code for our project. 
          </li>
        </ul>

      <h3><b>Project Proposal:   <span class="w3-opacity">February 10, 2020</span></b></h3>
      <hr>
      <h5>Overview:</h5>
    </div>
    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>For our project, we propose making an automatic pet hydration station, using a STMP32L47G. This project is motivated by our upbringing in homes with pets, during which we found that hydration is essential to our pet’s health and must be reliable.<br>   Physically the system is made up of four modules: a water bowl, a water dispenser with a valve, a motor to open and close the valve and a sensor fixed within the bowl, measuring the water level.<br>    The water dispenser will refill the pet’s water bowl after the water level falls below a certain threshold at which the sensor is no longer submerged in water.<br>   The sensor’s exposure will cause an interrupt. The response will be a buzzer noise to get the animal away and the rotation of the motor, causing the valve on the bottom of the water dispenser to open for a given period of time, thus allowing water to flow into the bowl. A second interrupt will stop the buzzer close the valve by turning the motor, and thus the valve, in the opposite direction, thus stopping the water flow. As long as the sensor is submerged in water, no action will be taken. </p>
      <h5>Peripherals:</h5>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Motor to open and close the water dispenser valve (Servo Motor)</li>
        <li>A buzzer i2S because its related to audio which is typically that protocol</li>
        <li>Sensor to sense water level falling below threshold using some protocol most likely I2C</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Goals:</h5>
        <p>Our goal is to learn more about how to interface with peripherals with Microcontrollers, such as the STMP32L47G, and thereby to create a project that is useful to us and other users. Our priority is to create a reliable pet hydration station. If further time and resources are available, we would like to expand this project and build a pet feeding station, based on the same principles.</p>
      <h5>Software Design:</h5>
        <p>While the sensor is submerged in water, no action is taken. An interrupt will occur when the sensor is no longer submerged in water. This will cause one of the GPIO pins to turn High/Low (depending on the sensor model we choose). In turn, this will cause an interrupt, which willand trigger the buzzer and trigger the movement of the motor (to open the valve) and start a timer. When the time elapses, a second interrupt will occur, triggering the buzzer to stop and triggering the movement of the motor to close the valve again. </p>
      <h5>Group Responsibilities:</h5>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>Andrew and Alice will work on the code together.</li>
          <li>Alice will be the primary responsible for all hardware: selecting and ordering the parts (i.e. the humidity sensor, the motor, the water dispenser and the bowl)</li>
          <li>Andrew will be the primary responsible for all software: design of peripheral interaction via serial interface.</li>
        </ul>

      <p>I am a in my third year at the University of California, Santa Barbara studing Computer Engineering. I am very excited for this project 
      because I am very passionate applying my skills to real world applications even if it is something as simple as keeping your pets fed! I 
      am escpecially excited to work with the STMP32L476VG discovery board microcontroller more and integrate more peripherals.</p>
